# 🖥️ System Monitor Tool (C++)

A lightweight **System Monitor Tool** written in **C++** that displays real-time information about running processes, CPU usage, memory load, and system statistics — similar to the Linux `top` command.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project was developed as **Assignment 3 (LSP)** to demonstrate the use of:
- **System calls** for process and resource monitoring  
- **Real-time data refresh** using `/proc` file system  
- **Process management** (sorting, listing, and killing processes)  

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Displays real-time:
- CPU usage percentage  
- Memory usage percentage  
- Total and running processes  
- Process list with PID, User, CPU%, MEM%, and Command  

✅ Supports:
- Sorting by **CPU** or **Memory usage**  
- Killing processes by **PID**  
- Real-time auto-refresh every few seconds
